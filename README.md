# Code-sample project

This is a small Java code sample for trainee applicants to be used as a starting
point for discussing code and problem-solving.

## Building and running

It has been tested in IntelliJ and Eclipse (see the official documentation for
IntelliJ and Eclipse on how to import or open a gradle project). It's also
possible to build it from the command line using `gradle build` and run
using `gradle run` if gradle is installed.

## Suggested modifications

* Only show names starting with a given letter.
* Combine names with age and display them as "firstName lastName, age". The list
  of ages match up to the list of names.
